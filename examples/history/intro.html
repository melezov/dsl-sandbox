<p><strong>History</strong> concept is used to log changes made to an object. Using history provides information about object values in each point in time a change was made.</p>
<p>This DSL defines a single root with history. In PHP, we can get a list of all changes made to an object by calling the getHistory method. Each entry in history list consists of:
<ul>
     <li>time the change was performed</li>
     <li>type of performed action (one of INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE)</li>
     <li>the resulting object value</li>
</ul>
