<p><strong>Domain event</strong> represents an event that occurred in the system. Events have identity, properties defined in DSL, and behavior defined in server-side code. Submitting an event will execute its code on the server, with values assigned to event properties functioning as arguments. Events are one of crucial concepts in the domain-driven design and are preferred way of manipulating data in place of simple CRUD operations.</p>
<p>This DSL shows an event named <em>MarkDone</em> that will assign <em>isDone</em> property of one Task to <em>true</em>. Take a look at <em>MarkDoneHandler.cs</em> for implementation .</p>
