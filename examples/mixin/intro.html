<p><strong>Mixin</strong> allows code reuse. Mixin should be used when multiple objects share identical properties. Including mixin in object will result in copying properties defined in mixin into the object.</p>
<p>The example shows two DSL files, with and without the usage of mixin. In 'cms-without-mixin.dsl' all 3 objects contain <em>createdAt</em> and <em>modifiedAt</em> properties. In 'cms.dsl' those properties are taken out into a mixin. Both DSL files are semantically the same, using mixin has only changed the syntax.</p>
