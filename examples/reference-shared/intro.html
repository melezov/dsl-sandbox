<p><strong>Shared references</strong> occur when two or more objects reference the same object. Different ojects can reference identical object types, as long as they never reference the same instance. Reason for disallowing this is aggregate object boundary. In domain driven design, aggregate root plays a role of consistency and integrity boundary. That means all interactions with aggregate members must go through the aggregate. The reason why sharing same instances is disallowed is that would allow other objects outside of aggregate boundary to manipulate it's members.</p>
<p>This example shows a blog where both posts and user profiles can be commented on. Both Blog and User contain a collection of Comment references. They share the same type, but cannot share the same comment instances.</p>
<p>Note that another valid approach is to introduce two separate entities (e.g. UserComment, PostComment) and reference them in User and Post respectively.</p>
