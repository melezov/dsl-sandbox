<p>Each property defined in DSL is mapped to a corresponding type in PHP.</p>
<p>This example shows DSL types that map to <strong>PHP's built-in and custom classes</strong>.</p>
<p>Complex properties can be assigned an object value, or a scalar value that is a valid type for object constructor. Internally, magic __set method will call the appropriate constructor with passed in scalar value.</p>
