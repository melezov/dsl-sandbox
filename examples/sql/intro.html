<p><strong>SQL</strong> concept is used to execute arbitrary SQL queries. SQL queries are performed by searching or counting the sql object. Additional specifications can be used to filter sql results.</p>
<p>Note that SQL should be used <em>only</em> for a good reason. Most of the time concepts such as <em>snowflake</em>, <em>report</em> and <em>specification</em> can be combined to provide desired results. SQL should be used only in cases when those concepts aren't sufficient.</p>
