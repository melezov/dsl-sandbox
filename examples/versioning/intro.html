<p><strong>Versioning</strong> allows properties to be auto maintained by the server on each insert and update. Versioning can be used on following types: <em>date</em>, <em>timestamp</em>, <em>GUID</em>, <em>string</em> and <em>integer</em> types.</p>
<p>Versioning assigns a new value when new object is created or an existing one is changed. If you try to update object identical to the one already persisted, no operation occurs, so versioning property will remain the same.</p>
