<p><strong>Generic search</strong> can be used to perform customized searches. Unlike search using specification, generic search needs no interventions in DSL, but can be performed in runtime.</p>
<p>@todo reference: link/list of search methods</p>
<p>Note that generic search should be used only where necessary. For commonly used searches, it is preferred to write a specification in place of generic search. Specifications are generally faster as they can be compiled and optimized by the server beforehand execution.</p>
<p>This example shows how to emulate a complex specification by using generic search. Search is performed by creating search object and calling filter methods, of which each states a certain condition.</p>
